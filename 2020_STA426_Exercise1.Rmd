### Problem 3: 

Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25) and create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale.

Report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text

```{r}
rm(list=ls())

## create log-normal distribution, µ ≈ mean, sigma ≈ sd
x <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)

## plot distribution on log scale
hist(log(x))

## mean of log-normal distribution x
mean(x)

## variance of log-normal distribution x
var(x)

```
